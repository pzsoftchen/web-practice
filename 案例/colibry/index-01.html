        <p class="w-content">Depilation removes hair at the surface level, while epilation removes the entire hair and lasts longer than depilation.</p>
        <p class="w-content">Here you will find the smartest and chicest tool for epilation: COLIBRY removes body hair follicles, delaying the re-growth until hair bulbs are reformed.</p>

        <h1 class="w-content">Conventional Hair Removal Technique Pain Points</h1>
        <p class="w-content">Let's be honest: how much do you struggle to remove body hair? How much do you spend on body care? No matter the answer. What we know is that:</p>
        <ul class="p-content center">
            <li>Razors and Chemicals are as quick as they are dangerous, and hair grows back faster and stronger. This method certainly cannot be included in the hashtag #bodycare.</li>
            <li>Waxing and Electric Epilators are as efficient as they are painful, not to mention that they both waste materials and energy; they also react aggressively with the skin, thereby causing irritation.</li>
            <li>Electroepilators and Laser are even more dangerous and infinitely more expensive. Above all, the "burning" of the skin that these techniques require is quite far from the idea of natural beauty.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tech-img w-image w-content center">
        </div>
        <p class="w-content">That's why COLIBRY is committed to threading epilation, because the ancient tradition is still the best option that we have to remove body hair efficiently.</p>

        <p class="w-content center"><span>COLIBRY</span> is a whole new concept: it's <span>DELICATE</span> on the skin without irritation, actually stimulating <span>MICRO-CIRCULATION</span> under skin tissue; it epilates with <span>LONG DURATION</span> and weakens the hair; it's
            <span>ECOLOGICAL</span> because it doesn't need batteries and doesn't produce waste; it's <span>PRECISE</span> because you can see clearly where you are epilating; and it's <span>CHEAP</span> because you only need Colibry, and voilà - it's
            done

        <div class="works-desc w-content center">
            <p>This technique of hair removal is possible thanks to a durable thread which is coiled up to form a small spiral: rendering hair uprooting possible because hair remains trapped following the hand movement</p>
            <p>Colibry is designed to save time and allows you to easily move around removing even the shortest hair from the skin.</p>
